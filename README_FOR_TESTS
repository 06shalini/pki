         Setting up and running the tests for Dogtag Certificate System
        ================================================================

** Note- All the paths mentioned in this document start from the root of the
          cloned source tree.

1. Running the tests on local machine.

1.1.Running the tests standalone in Eclipse(only the Java tests (JUnit v>=4.11))

  1.1.1. Setting up the test environment.

         The test environment has to be setup using the deploment configuration
         file tests/dogtag/dev_java_tests/deploy.cfg (the -f option for
         pkispawn).

         If there are any changes to the values in this file, they must also be
         updated in tests/dogtag/dev_java_tests/test.cfg. (Used by the tests)
         The files, when used as they are, will run the tests successfully.

   **Note- The test environment has to be setup before running the tests.
           The tests do not setup the environment.
   **Note- The details of the nssdb holding the ca_admin_cert.p12 has to be
           updated in the test.cfg for running the tests.

  1.1.2. Running the tests

         The tests can be either run individually or as as part of a suite.
         To run the tests as a suite, Open BeakerTestSuite and run as JUnit
         test.
         A suite is a test runner which executes all the tests added to it
         using the $SuiteClasses tag.

         A customized suite, PKITestSuite, is used to provide additional
         functionality when the tests are run on a beaker test machine.

         To run the tests individually(a class like CATestJunit),
         just run the class as a JUnitTest.

1.2.Running all the tests on a beaker test machine from command line.

  1.2.1 Setting up a beaker client on a local machine.

        The following steps help setup a beaker client for creating the task rpm
        and submitting the beaker job to the beaker server.

        -- Create a repo file in /etc/yum.repos.d, ex. beaker-client.repo, with
           the following content.

           [beaker-client]
           name=Beaker Client - Fedora<version>
           baseurl=http://beaker-project.org/yum/client/Fedora<version>
           enabled=1
           gpgcheck=0

           [beaker-client-testing]
           name=Beaker Client - Fedora<version> Testing
           baseurl=http://beaker-project.org/yum/client-testing/Fedora<version>
           enabled=0
           gpgheck=0

        -- Install the packages(yum): expect, beakerlib, beaker-client, rhts-devel

        -- Create a file /etc/beaker/client.conf (if not already present the
           packages are installed) and paste this content.

           # Base URL of the Beaker server (without trailing slash!)
           HUB_URL = "<BEAKER_SERVER_URL>"
           # Hub authentication method
           AUTH_METHOD = "krbv"
           #AUTH_METHOD = "password"

           # Username and password
           USERNAME = "example"
           #PASSWORD = ""

           # Kerberos principal. If commented, default principal obtained by kinit is used.
           #KRB_PRINCIPAL = "host/$HOSTNAME"

           # Kerberos keytab file.
           #KRB_KEYTAB = "/etc/krb5.keytab"

           # Kerberos service prefix. Example: host, HTTP
           #KRB_SERVICE = "HTTP"

           # Kerberos realm. If commented, last two parts of domain name are used. Example: MYDOMAIN.COM.
           KRB_REALM = ""

           # Kerberos credential cache file.
           #KRB_CCACHE = ""

           Provide the details as per the authentication protocol used by the
           server: Username/Password or a Kerberos login.

        This sets up the machine as a beaker client, on which new task rpms can
        be built and new jobs submitted to the beaker server.
        A beaker job is an XML file. The template used to create a job is in
        tests/beaker/rhcs/beakerjob.rhcs.xml.template.

  1.2.2 Building the beaker task rpm and submitting a beaker job.

     ** Building the task rpm and submitting the job to a beaker server is done
        by executing the compose script in pki/scripts:

        ./compose_pki_test_package User-ID_for_personalization Job_xml_config_file [--runtests]

        The builds are done in <pki_source_root>/../package.tests/ folder.

        -- The user id is for personalizing the rpm.

           This path at which the test source is extracted from the rpm on the
           beaker server is specified by the TEST variable in the
           Makefile (pki/tests/beaker/rhcs/Makefile).

           So another rpm with the same to-be-extracted path overwrites
           the existing test code.
           In order to prevent it, a unique id is asked to personalize the rpm
           to provide a unique to-be-extracted path for every test rpm of
           dogtag tests (especially at a user level).

        -- Job_xml_configuration_file (the absolute path of the file from /)
           - to configure the recipe of a job.

           The contents of the file should be:

           [DEFAULT]
           repos=http://<REPO_HOST_NAME>/pki/F20/RPMS/noarch
                 http://<REPO_HOST_NAME>/pki/F20/RPMS/x86_64
           hostname=
           distro_family=Fedora20
           distro_name=Fedora-20-Alpha
           distro_arch=x86_64

           The repos parameter should the URL's for accessing the dogtag rpms.
           The hostname means the hostname of a specific beaker test machine.
           The distro_* are the details of the distribution on the beaker
           server, that has to be installed on the test machine.

        -- The optional --runtests option.
           Without the --runtests options the task rpm and the job xml are
           not submitted to the beaker server.

     ** An already built rpm/job (built without the --runtests option above)
        can be submitted to a beaker server by:

        ./run_tests [--wait-on-beaker-job]

        -- The run_tests just submits the task rpm and job xml to beaker.
           But specifying --wait-on-beaker-job option, the process is
           blocked until the job is completed.

     ** Creating a repository of the built rpms.

        A --createrepo option has been added to be used by the build compose
        scripts. For example:

        ./compose_pki_core_packages --createrepo=<repository_location_details> hybrid_rpms

        builds the rpms, copied them to the location specified in the file
        passed as the value to the option and creates it as a repository.
        If the location specified is hosted on a httpd server, this repository
        URL can be in the job xml. The file should contain the following:

        ### Location where the files have to be copied ###
	### Same parameter for both local and remote ###
	REPOSITORY_LOCATION=/var/www/html/pki

	### Remote host details###
	REMOTE_HOSTNAME_OR_IP=
	USERNAME=
	PASSWORD=

        If a remote host name is provided then the repos are scp'ed at the
        location provided on the remote host using the credentials provided.
        (If no login credentials are provided, then a prompt appears asking
         for them.)

**Note- In the case of creating a repository on a remote machine, the remote
        machine must be a known_host to the local machine.

2. Setting up a Jenkins server for continuous integration testing

  -- Install Jenkins. (It is better to configure the Jenkins server to use a
                       port other than 8080)

  -- Create a New Project - ex: Dogtag-pki

  -- Configuring the project (Click on "Configure" in the left panel):

     * Setting up the workspace:

       i. For continuous integration, the project can be configured to clone
          the source from the repository (git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/pki.git).
          To use the Git SCM, install the Jenkins-Git plugin.
          Goto Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins to find and install
          the plugin. The Git option can be found in the SCM section.

       ii. For using the working project directory as the source to build the
           rpms - Select None in the SCM section and set the path to the
           project root (pki) as custom workspace in the Advanced Project Options section.
           Click on Advanced -> Select Use custom workspace -> Enter the path.

   -- Building the rpms and running the tests.

      In the "Build" section, select "Add build step" -> "Execute Shell"
      Paste the following code in the Command text box.

      cd $WORKSPACE/scripts; ./compose_pki_core_packages [--createrepo=<repository_file_absolute_path>] hybrid_rpms
      echo "Compose the test package and submit the beaker task and job"
      cd $WORKSPACE/scripts; ./compose_pki_test_package <UserID> <Job_XML_config_file_absolute_path> --runtests

      This will build the rpms, create the repo(if specified), compose
      the test rpm and submit the tests to the beaker.
      (The description to the commands used and setting up the beaker-client
       are specified in the previous sections of this document)

   -- The Build Triggers section provides options for specifying the time at
      which a new build can be triggered - periodically or on a git commit.

   -- If no Build triggers are configured in the project, the build process can be initiated by clicking on "Build Now" link in the left panel.
      The console output can be viewed by clicking the "Console Output" link.
