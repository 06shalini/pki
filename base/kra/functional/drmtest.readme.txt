You will need to set up a few things first though:
1.  Install a CA/KRA.  It this is not on the default ports, you will
need to modify the connection information in KRAClient.__main__

2. The python code uses python-requests to talk to the server, and
requests uses openssl.  That means you need to export your DRM admin
cert to a PEM file, so that it can be used for client auth.  I did this
as follows:

 openssl pkcs12 -in ~/.dogtag/pki-tomcat/ca_admin_cert.p12 -out /tmp/temp4.pem -nodes

Without any changes, the code in KRAClient.__main__ assumes this file
will be in /tmp/temp4.pem.

3.  We do some crypto functions using NSS commands (like generating a
symmetric key or wrapping using the transport cert).  Therefore, we need
to create an NSS database and populate it with the transport cert.  The
code expects it to be at /tmp/drmtest/certdb

I did this as follows:
mkdir -p /tmp/drmtest/certdb
certutil -N -d /tmp/drmtest/certdb
chmod +r /tmp/drmtest/certdb/*

certutil -L -d /var/lib/pki/pki-tomcat/alias/ -n "transportCert cert-pki-tomcat KRA" -a > transport_cert.txt
certutil -A -d /tmp/drmtest/certdb/ -n "kra transport cert" -i ./transport_cert.txt -a -t "u,u,u"

4. Then just run kraclient.__main__ with no arguments.
